### Project Summary

MyWonder is a platform for big data analytics and visualization:
Our vision is to enable our customers to create visualizations with ease from massive files within a short time period, by the method of distributing the files on the cloud.

### Waste

# Motion:
For “I have to call our customer assistance team constantly, which takes time from my meetings with clients.”, It is a waste of Motion. Just like a doctor leaving patient rooms for getting supplies or record, the CEO seeking for customer assistance while in meetings with the clients could be considered as the similar type of waste.

# Transport/Waiting
For “In addition, customer support has told me that they talked to the designers, who then met with the developers, that updating contents can only be done by the backend team. I understand that we need to test new functionalities, but I need access to someone who can quickly change contents before a demo” this part is a waste of Transport and Waiting. The CEO cannot reach to the backend team directly to change content, he has to communicate from person to person to contact the position in charge of updating content. Poor project team layout is causing the waste of Transport.

# Skill
For “I have to call our customer assistance team constantly, which takes time from my meetings with clients. In addition, customer support has told me that they talked to the designers, who then met with the developers, that updating contents can only be done by the backend team.”, it is a waste of Skill, just like Nurses and Doctors spending time locating equipment and supplies, the customer support spending time locating the person who is in charge of updating content before demo.
